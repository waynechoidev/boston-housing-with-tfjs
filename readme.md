# Boston Housing with TFJS

### Simulation of Linear Regression and Custom MLP Models using Tensorflow.js

Dive into a web-based machine learning training that explores both
linear regression and custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models with
Tensorflow.js. The project utilizes [the Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) for practical application.
